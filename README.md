### Full Stack Web Dev Veggie Digital Garden

Welcome to my collection of Full Stack Web Dev "Veggies", or tips, tricks, tutorials, and anything related to Web Dev that is useful, fun or cool. This project follows the style of ["Digital Gardens"](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) which is a knowledge publishing philosophy that doesn't follow traditional blogging methodologies, but rather a unique, small collection of websites that contain its own style of sharing knowledge. A Digital Garden is like your own little corner of the internet to grow and nurture your own content in a healthy and clean way that you want it to be created - that is my take on it.

## Buy Me a Coffee

If you want to. If you find this useful or like my template (coming in next version) or anything else, it would really help me. I am a struggling full stack web developer who hasn't yet landed a job and has been living with zero income besides my fiance's social worker salary and waitressing job that she busts her ass at for 10 hours a day. I really am trying to get a job, but every penny helps as it will help us not get kicked out of our apartment and can help us get by until our tax refund shows up OR I get my first Web Developer Paycheck.

I've been close too - I've been 99% sure I was hired for good paying freelance gigs three times now, just to have the other party back down due to time committments or other reasons. 

### I Will Even Build You Your Own Digital Garden!

You know you want one! But seriously, any donations are welcome to request their own personal digital garden or help setting it up for donating and helping me out. I am so gracious for your help, even $1 and I'll get you a fully-functioning Digital Garden with all future updates as well.

### But seriously

Thank you for checking out my Web Dev Veggies. I plan on adding a bunch when I get then chance, but I am a web dev maniac. I'm also currently working on a React Commerce Store, Shopify App, Python Django Portfolio Site, and Freelance Business Website... Oh and applying for jobs. If you could share my work with anyone who may be hiring or may need my services as a Full Stack Web Dev, please share my info - I would appreciate it more than you know!


Sincerely,

@GEAUXWEISBECK4
