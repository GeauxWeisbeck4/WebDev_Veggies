# Full Stack Web Dev Veggies 

**Welcome to the Full Stack WebDev Veggie Digital Garden!**

My name is Andrew and I love to make Digital Gardens and really love to create things as a web 
developer! 

"A digital garden is like a personal wiki and a knowledge database of thoughts and ideas. Similar to a traditional garden, a digital one will also container various kinds of content (plants), of which may even be unrelated to each other. Ideas are not refined, thoughts are not tailored. -[GitHub user and theme abvarun/digital-garden-hugo-theme](https://github.com/apvarun/digital-garden-hugo-theme/tree/main/exampleSite)

The Full Stack Web Dev Veggie garden is a bunch of web dev tutorials that I have typed out and 
included for later content and to share with you! I have made so many fun projects over the last 
year, I don't want to keep my ideas to myself. You can find anything related to Full Stack Web Development here.

<hr />

I decided to call them veggies because they are tasty little documents that are good for your Full Stack Development health! Grab yourself some HTML carrots, CSS peppers, or JavaScript 
tomatoes and check out my recipes for a great web dev experience.
